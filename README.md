* To try out GNOME 3, use the portage config files in status/portage-configs. It
  is recommended to symlink the package.keywords.gnome3 and package.mask.gnome3
  files, and copy the others to the proper place.
* Read man portage to know the proper place to copy/symlink these files. In
  particular, note that /etc/portage/package.{keywords,mask} can be directories.
* If you have bugs, please report them to Gentoo for triaging before contacting
  upstream. Bugs might be gentoo-specific, in which case you would waste
  upstream's time.
* While reporting bugs to bugs.gentoo.org, please prepend "[gnome-overlay]" to
  the subject for ease of finding.
* #gentoo-desktop @ FreeNode is the proper place for questions. Note that the
  gnome team is severely understaffed, so it might take us time to reply.
